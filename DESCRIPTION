Description: Importing tools for ASCII csv data from Cary Eclipse Spectrometer
    The csv files are saved on the spectrometer. This package enables rapid plotting of
    the data collected and also provides a method to add fitted lognormal peaks (currently derived 
    from an external fitting program). The number of data points and scans must be known
    before importing data. 
    TODO: Add internal fitting functions, background subtraction feature
